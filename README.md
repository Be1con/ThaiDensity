# Thailand's Density Data as consumable API
Thai Density is a consumable dataset for the density in Thailand. The data is provided by the National Statistic Office of Thailand, converted to consumable APIs.

## Why I created this repository?
I am working on my thesis project, and on area that I found it is hard to work on is density data, since the National Statistic Office of Thailand provided only Excel format, not consumable one. So, I decided to created my own consumable data and make it available to everyone to use.

## Project Status
Since, I needed to rewrite this from scratch, I need to take some time to make it available to everyone, as intended. As soon as the project is ready to launch, I will let you know in this repository. So, please keep your eye on this.

## Want to contribute?
Just use pull request for me to review the codebase, and I will merge to my main repository.
